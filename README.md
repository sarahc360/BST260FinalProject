### Overview and Motivation - Anu
Gender inequality, a widely prevalent social phenomenon, has risen to the forefront of global discussion after the COVID- 19 pandemic. An article published by UN women (https://data.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/Whose-time-to-care-brief_0.pdf) states that while women already spent about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic work than men, the pandemic has exacerbated this gap. During the pandemic, women spent more hours in care and domestic work. Women were also more likely than men to leave the workforce , potentially as a consequence of increased workloads. 

While some countries tried to reduce the burden of women by offering cash benefits and care facilities, data shows that an overwhelming percentage of the worlds women and girls will be facing impoverished conditions as a result of the pandemic. 

Through this project we want to get a better understanding of the economic disadvantages that women face worldwide. By exploring factors such as differences in time spent in paid and unpaid work, leadership representation and maternity leave among others, we want to present a coherent picture of the economic and political gender disparities across OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries in this dataset. 

### Related Work - Anu 

Our motivation for this project was the article (link provided above) published by UN Women which dives deep into disparities in unpaid domestic work as a result of the COVID pandemic and an interactive dashboard (https://interactive.unwomen.org/multimedia/explainer/unpaidcare/en/index.html?gclid=CjwKCAiA78aNBhAlEiwA7B76p5E1YtiUgfS3TnuIViVn56UPe4krtgSfQtNlM2G8TeP2Od7f5VzjPRoCCJgQAvD_BwE) which allows individuals to calculate the amount of time they spend on unpaid domestic and care tasks and how that compares to the global average. 

### Initial Questions - Kelly


### Data - Sarah


### Exploratory Analysis - Dipal


### Final Analysis - Julia
Final analysis for Maps: The maps allow us to hypothesize that in countries where women spend more time in unpaid work, men usually spend more time in paid work. Women may also have less representation in leadership positions in countries where they spend more time in unpaid work compared to men and/ or countries where men spend more time in paid work compared to women.
